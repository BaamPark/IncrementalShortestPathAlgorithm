# IncrementalShortestPathAlgorithm


## Week1
- implemented PR (incremental shortest path) algorithm proposed by Ramalingam and Rep

## Week2
- Wrote unit testing with five test cases to assess the floyd Warshall algorithm
- Added reference papers folders, start to work on an algorithm by CAMIL DEMETRESCU and GIUSEPPE F. ITALIANO.

## Week3
- Read papers, Find more related papers.

## Week4
- Implemented LDSP algorithm proposed in 2004.
- Implemented QUINCA algorithm proposed in 2016
- Wrote unit testing for QUINCA and PR algorithms
- Benchmarked the QUINCA, PR , LDSP algorithms
