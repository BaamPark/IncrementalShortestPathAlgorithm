# IncrementalShortestPathAlgorithm


## Week1
- implement incremental shortest path algorithm proposed by Ramalingam and Rep

## Week2
- Write unit testing with five test cases to assess the floyd Warshall algorithm
- Added reference papers folders, start to work on an algorithm by CAMIL DEMETRESCU and GIUSEPPE F. ITALIANO.

## Week3
- Read papers, Find more related papers.

## Week4
- Implement the first step of an incremental shortest path algorithm proposed in 2004. It's a complicated algorithm with multiple steps.
